# Using APIs with Express

In this lab, we're going to combo the use of 2 APIs. First, we'll have the user enter a location (a landmark or an address) into a form. We'll take that information and translate it into GPS coordinates, or latitude-longitude. Finally, we'll give those coordinates to [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev/account) to see what the current weather is.

## Getting started

#### 1. FORK IT! CLONE IT!

You won't need to turn in this assignment, but you should fork and clone this repository for its starter code.

#### 2. Run `npm install`. 

This will install the dependecies you need to run an Express app from the `package.json` file.

#### 3. Create a file called `.env` at the root level. You can do this by running the command `touch .env`.

#### 4. Take a peek at the starter code

You've got a basic Node/Express app going on here. Take a look at it and get familiar with what it does. Make sure you can run the server and get to the home page.
